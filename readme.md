# Prime Factor Finder

This project was heavily based on an old assgnment that I never quite wrapped my head around for my Software Tools & Systems Programming class.
The idea was to write an algorithm based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime factors of a number using processes and pipes in C. **With the current implementation, the program works for numbers up to and including 17542**.
